Question 1:

Diffie Hellman key exchange Algorithm:

Given that prime number q=353, the primitive root of 353, g=3. A and B select private keys Xa = 97; Xb = 233

generate key pairs and compute secret Key

Question 2:

Diffie Hellman key exchange Algorithm:

Given that prime number q=71, the primitive root of 71, g=7. A and B select private keys Xa = 5; Xb = 12

generate key pairs and compute secret Key

Question 3:

Diffie Hellman key exchange Algorithm:

Given that prime number q=11, the primitive root of 11, g=2.

1. show that 2 is primitive root of 11
2. if user A has public key Ya = 9, what is A's private key Xa?
3. if user B has public key Yb = 3, what is the secret key K shared with A?
